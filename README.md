# Height
A project to add height attributes to road lines using open data

The objectives of this project are:-

- to gather open data related to height (GB focus initially)
- to create an algorithm for normalising a point height across all data sets
- to create a data set of road line strings with Z values 
- to create a data set of gradient markers 
- to create a catalogue of all road hills in GB
